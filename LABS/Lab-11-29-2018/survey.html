    <p> Michael Greenblatt writes in the Game Studies Journal that a true
      visual novel is one in which characters have a set amount of dialogue,
      gameplay is static, and more often than not there are branching decisions
      made by a reader/player (Greenblatt)</p>

    <h2>The Pixel Art Years</h2>
    <p>The game company Taito created the most Visual Novels during <thead>
      era 1985 - 1995 and this was the most successful span of years for
      this particular game genre (Wikipedia)
