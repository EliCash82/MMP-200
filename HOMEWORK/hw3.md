**3 Screenshots**

1. Screenshot of at least 2 layers, each layer containing an image with unique resolutions
2. Screenshot of your HTML file demonstrating mastery of Bootstrap grid system and ability to make images responsive.
3. Screenshot of your HTML file within your web browser demonstrating the use of two column row (grid system) and images of differing aspect ratios.
