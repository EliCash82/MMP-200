For homework this week you will build a text logo with one of the effects we completed in the 10/4/18 Lab in Photoshop and you will add a simplified text-only version of this same logo to your navigation bar.

(1 screenshot in Photoshop; 1 screenshot of your HTML/CSS + Photoshop Logo working in-browser)

You will also build out a simple SCRUM board for use when building out your Midterm Proposal.
