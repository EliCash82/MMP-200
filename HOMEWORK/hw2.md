# Homework Assignment Two

Create a new **CSS FILE** and use it to override the styling of `bootstrap.css` in the following ways:

1. `H1` text should be a shade of **blue**.
2. `H1` text should be displayed with the `Courier` font.

Create within Photoshop (Or [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org) an image that has 2 layers.

Take the following screenshots:

1. A screenshot of your Development Environment (I should see the jquery file, the bootstrap css file, the javascript file, the HTML file, and your unique css file*)
2. A screenshot of your HTML file in the text editor.
3. A screenshot of your unique CSS file in the text editor.
4. A screenshot of your website within the web browser of your choice.
5. A screenshot of your Photoshop (or Gimp) environment where both layers are visible.

**BONUS CHALLENGE** (Not required): Use bootstrap to create a grid.  Export an image with transparency and place the image on the page twice, in columns next to one another.  Take a screenshot of them side by side in the browser.  Narrow your browser window and take another screenshot showing the images one on top of the other.
