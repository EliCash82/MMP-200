Midterm Proposal Template

For this week&#39;s assignment you will be making a Midterm Proposal Template.  This will serve as boilerplate for your Midterm Proposal due in November.

Create 7 individual pages and have them link to one another through the navigation bar.  Use <strong>lorem ipsum</strong> (filler text) <http://www.openculture.com/2015/03/the-story-of-lorem-ipsum.html to fill each page with at least 350 words (Except for works cited page
which should just be an ordered list of at least six `li`s.

Use this image <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EliCash82/MMP-200/master/MIDTERM-AND-FINAL/placeholder.png> to place 14 images throughout your template.  You can do 2 on each page or arrange them differently if you would like.

Give each of the pages the following titles:</p>

1. Challenge Statement
2. Survey the Field
3. Research Site A
4. Research Site B
5. Research Site C
6. Goals and Challenges
7. Works Cited

This homework requires 14 screenshots: one of each page in browser, one of each page in Atom (or selected text editor) where the full directory of files is visible in the sidebar -- including bootstrap CSS and JS files).  Remember you can always submit extra screenshots to illustrate a problem you are looking to find a solution to.
